##  Elevator Pitch

CardioSense AI is an explainable AI-powered cardiovascular decision support system that not only predicts heart disease risk but also explains the reasoning behind predictions and simulates how lifestyle changes can reduce that risk.

Unlike traditional models, it combines:
- **High-performance ML** (XGBoost + Optuna)
- **Clinical Safety Engine** (ACC/AHA Guideline Overrides)
- **Risk Optimization** (Least Effort Roadmap)
- **Explainability** (SHAP and LIME)
- **Clinical Reporting** (Professional PDF Generation)

**Transforming prediction into actionable medical intelligence.**

##  System Narrative: The Interpretability Gap

Cardiovascular disease is the world's leading killer, yet clinical adoption of AI is hampered by the "Black Box" problem. Most models provide a risk score without an explanation, leaving clinicians unable to trust or validate the AI's "intuition."

**CardioSense AI** is a professional **Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS)** designed to bridge this gap. By combining high-performance machine learning with state-of-the-art explainability, clinical guardrails, and preventive simulation, it transforms raw data into trustable, actionable medical intelligence.

##  Quick Start

### 1. Environment Initialization
```bash
# Clone and enter directory
cd CardioSense-AI
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
# Install clinical stack
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Execution Pathways
**Run Training & Optimization Pipeline:**
```bash
python main.py
```

**Launch Clinical Diagnostic Dashboard:**
```bash
streamlit run app/main.py
```

**Launch Production API Service:**
```bash
# Configure via env vars (optional)
export HOST=0.0.0.0
export PORT=8000
uvicorn api.main:app
```

- **The Preprocessing Pipeline**: Utilizes a Scikit-Learn `ColumnTransformer` with `StandardScaler` for vitals and `OneHotEncoder` for categorical clinical markers, ensuring training-inference consistency.
- **The Safety & Trust Framework**: Implements ACC/AHA guideline overrides and out-of-distribution (OOD) monitoring.
- **The Optimization Engine**: Calculates the "Least Effort Path" to risk reduction using clinical cost-weights.
- **The Explainability Engine**: Powered by SHAP and LIME for local feature-level contributions and model reasoning.
- **Adaptive Monitoring Layer**: Automated Data/Concept drift detection with self-healing fallback for cross-environment stability.
- **Security & Compliance**: Hardened against OWASP-style attacks; Bandit/Safety audited CI/CD pipeline.
- **Modern Infrastructure**: Fully integrated **FastAPI Lifespan** management and hardened monitoring (variance guards).
