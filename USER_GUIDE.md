### Patient Inputs & Risk Pulse
- **Sidebar**: Input traditional cardiovascular risk factors (Age, BP, Cholesterol, etc.).
- **Reliability Score**: Active **v2.4.0** engine (**88.52% Acc**) ensures production-grade stability.

2. **Deep Dive Modules**

### Diagnosis & Benchmarks
Analyze the **underlying drivers** of the patient's risk.

![Actionable LIME Insights](../app/assets/App_Screenshots/4.png)

- **SHAP Waterfall Analysis**: Visualizes exactly how many percentage points each vital contributed to the overall risk. Red bars indicate increased risk; blue bars indicate protective factors.
- **LIME Linear Surrogates**: Provides a "local linear" view of the model's decision. It shows which features are most sensitive for that specific patient.
- **Patient Benchmarking**: Compare your patient's vitals against the **Healthy Median**.

### Risk Optimization Engine (Least Effort Path)
Move beyond simple "What-If" analysis to an AI-driven clinical strategy.

![Risk Optimization & Radar](../app/assets/App_Screenshots/6.png)

1. **Strategic Optimization**: Select a "Target Risk" percentage and run the solver.
2. **Spider (Radar) Visualization**: 
   - **Blue Shape**: The patient's high-risk profile.
   - **Green Shape**: The AI-calculated "Path to Green."
3. **Treatment Roadmap**: A prioritized sequence of lifestyle actions ranked by their risk-reduction ROI relative to effort.

3. **Interpreting the AI "Reasoning"**

The SHAP Waterfall plot is the "X-Ray" of the model's decision. It decomposes the 0-100% risk probability into the specific clinical reasons for why a patient was flagged.

- **`E[f(X)]`**: The average model output (the starting baseline).
- **`f(X)`**: The final risk probability for this specific patient.
- **Red Features**: Clinical factors that pushed the risk **Higher**.
- **Blue Features**: Clinical factors that pushed the risk **Lower**.

4. **Global Insights & Fairness**

### Population-Level Feature Importance
Understand dataset-wide summary drivers across all patients.

### Fairness & Equitable Care
CardioSense AI is audited to ensure that the AI model performs reliably across all patient demographics.

![Bias and Fairness Assessment](../app/assets/App_Screenshots/11.png)

- **Regional Parity**: We prioritize high **Recall (Sensitivity)** in historically marginalized or vulnerable subgroups (e.g., Female and Senior populations) to ensure no high-risk patient is missed due to algorithmic bias.

### Model Transparency & Integrity
The **System Integrity** module validates the underlying statistical performance of the clinical engine.

![System Integrity Dashboard](../app/assets/App_Screenshots/10.png)

- **Validation Confusion Matrix**: Visualizes true/false positives and negatives on the hold-out validation set.
- **Model Calibration Curve**: Ensures that the AI's predicted "Risk Pulse" aligns with actual clinical frequencies (Brier Score: 0.0814).

5. **Medical Safety Guardrails**

The engine implements a **multi-layered safety framework** to prevent AI hallucination in high-risk scenarios.

### Clinical Overrides (ACC/AHA Alignment)
The system will automatically escalate risk to **POSITIVE** if critical life-safety thresholds are breached:
- **Hypertensive Crisis**: Systolic BP >= 180 mmHg.
- **Multivessel Disease**: Number of major vessels (ca) >= 2.
- **Ischemic Severity**: ST depression (oldpeak) > 3.0.

### Entropy-Based Confidence
Every prediction includes a **Confidence Gauge** (1.0 - H(p)). These values are now more stable due to the **v2.4.0 Robust Preprocessing Pipeline**:
- **HIGH**: The AI has a clear, focused statistical rationale.
- **MODERATE**: Requires physician review.
- **LOW**: High entropy/ambiguity. The AI indicates a "Boundary Case."

6. **Generating Clinical PDF Reports**

After completing your assessment, generate a professional report for the patient's medical file:
1.  Input clinician observations.
2.  Click **"Download Clinical PDF Report"**.
    - **Clinical Audit Hash**: cryptographic link for medical records.

7. **Clinical Monitoring & Reliability**

The **Clinical Monitoring** tab allows physicians to monitor the system's "real-world" performance and data stability over time.

### Data Drift (Evidently AI)
This module monitors for shifts in the distribution of patient data (e.g., if the incoming population's average cholesterol suddenly spikes). 
- **Drift Share**: The percentage of clinical features currently showing statistical drift.
- **Dataset Drift**: A binary flag indicating if the overall population profile has significantly deviated from the validated training baseline.

### Performance Audit (Concept Drift)
By collecting ground-truth feedback from clinicians, the system tracks its **Recall Stability**.
- **Recall Drop**: Measures the decay in sensitivity compared to the 92.86% baseline.
- **Concept Drift Alert**: Scalates to clinicians if the model's predictive quality falls below acceptable safety thresholds.
